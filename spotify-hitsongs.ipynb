    "Music as an industry has revolved significantly in the past couple decades. With digital inventions such as iTunes by Apple (2001) and music streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, etc. revolutionizing this industry, listening to music has become very accessible for every individual.Therefore, music creators and artists have increasingly delved into this industry to pursue their passion and create original music/songs. Consequently, the music industry has become extremely competitive for artists willing to make a mark in the field and be successful by creating 'hit' songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify, a music streaming service launched in 2006, has become the world's largest music provider having 433 million total users as of 2022 in 184 markets/regions across the world. This has resulted in most songs having their primary listeners on Spotify and most number of listens/streams on this platform as well. Therefore, obtaining statistics from Spotify data would enable us to look into some interesting patterns/trends which make a 'hit' song.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how do we define a 'hit' song? Spotify's data includes a parameter for every music/song track called the 'popularity'. This is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. This 'popularity' is based on spotify's algorithm which utilizes statistics such as the total number of plays of the track and how recent those plays are. We use this metric to classify songs as a 'hit' song or not which we will explore in this essay later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this computational essay, we will primarily explore how certain non-musical factors, for example, release date of songs, album, etc. are correlated to the 'popularity' of a song and how these factors affect the successfulness of a song. To do this, we used Spotify's API to obtain data from 'The Million Playlist' dataset. We process this data to extract statistics for the non-musical factors being considered in this study and use visualizations to understand how these are related to the 'popularity' of a song."
