    "Music as an industry has revolved significantly in the past couple decades. With digital inventions such as iTunes by Apple (2001) and music streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, etc. revolutionizing this industry, listening to music has become very accessible for every individual.Therefore, music creators and artists have increasingly delved into this industry to pursue their passion and create original music/songs. Consequently, the music industry has become extremely competitive for artists willing to make a mark in the field and be successful by creating 'hit' songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify, a music streaming service launched in 2006, has become the world's largest music provider having 433 million total users as of 2022 in 184 markets/regions across the world. This has resulted in most songs having their primary listeners on Spotify and most number of listens/streams on this platform as well. Therefore, obtaining statistics from Spotify data would enable us to look into some interesting patterns/trends which make a 'hit' song.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how do we define a 'hit' song? Spotify's data includes a parameter for every music/song track called the 'popularity'. This is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. This 'popularity' is based on spotify's algorithm which utilizes statistics such as the total number of plays of the track and how recent those plays are. We use this metric to classify songs as a 'hit' song or not which we will explore in this essay later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this computational essay, we will primarily explore how certain non-musical factors, for example, release date of songs, album, etc. are correlated to the 'popularity' of a song and how these factors affect the successfulness of a song. To do this, we used Spotify's API to obtain data from 'The Million Playlist' dataset. We process this data to extract statistics for the non-musical factors being considered in this study and use visualizations to understand how these are related to the 'popularity' of a song."

    "1. Some non-musical factors can contribute significantly to the popularity of a song: This project highlights how factors like release date of songs, song artists, etc. play a role in determining the success of a song. However, we also found out that factors like track length, explicit lyrics, etc. actually have no major effect on the popularity/success of a song.\n",
    "2. Spotify's popularity metric is a useful tool for analyzing the success of a song: Spotify's popularity metric is based on a combination of factors, including the total number of plays and how recent those plays are. By using this metric, we can classify songs as \"hits\" or \"non-hits\" and analyze the factors that contribute to their success.\n",
    "3. Data analysis can provide valuable insights for decision-making in the music industry: By analyzing data from Spotify and other sources, we can gain valuable insights into what makes a song successful. These insights can be used by music producers, record labels, and artists to adjust their strategies and increase the likelihood of creating a hit song."

    "**Contextual Implications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The reliance on Spotify's algorithm for determining the popularity of a song: This algorithm is based on the number of plays and how recent those plays are, and it does not necessarily reflect the quality or artistic value of the song. Therefore, the analysis may not provide a complete picture of what makes a hit song, and it may overlook important factors such as the creativity and originality of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Another implication is the potential bias in the dataset used in the analysis. The Million Playlist dataset may not be representative of the entire population of Spotify users, and it may not include songs from certain genres or artists. Therefore, the results of the analysis may not be generalizable to the entire population of Spotify users or to the music industry as a whole.\n",

    "**Ethical implications:**\n",

    "The project's ethical implications primarily relate to data privacy and the responsible use of machine learning algorithms. The use of Spotify's API to obtain data from The Million Playlist dataset raises questions about data privacy and the ethical use of user data. It is essential to ensure that the data obtained through the API is anonymized and that the users' privacy is respected."

    "1. The importance of data processing and visualization: The project highlights the importance of processing and visualizing large datasets to understand patterns and trends.\n",

    "3. The limitations of relying on algorithmic metrics: The project raises concerns about relying solely on algorithmic metrics, such as Spotify's popularity metric, to evaluate the success of a song."

    "\n",
    "1. Extracting data from Spotify's API took a really long time to fetch data quite a few times.\n",
    "2. Reading track data from extracted data using Spotipy library was working fine for a while and then it stopped doing so which reflects some inconsistencies between real-time updates to Spotify's API conflicting with data fields in Spotipy (which does not get updated often)."

    "**Future Work:**\n",
    "1. Refining the analysis: After conducting an initial analysis, there may be opportunities to refine the analysis and explore additional factors that contribute to the success of a song. For example, you could explore how features of a song, such as tempo or duration, affect its popularity.\n",
    "2. Machine Learning: Using this analysis, we can identify features that do affect the popularity of a song and then use those features to create a Machine Learning model that could predict based on this feature data whether a song will become successful or not.\n",
    "3. Improving the tooling: This project could be turned into a more robust tool that could be used to analyze data and provide insights to a wider audience. For example, the tool could be turned into a web application that allows users to explore the data and conduct their own analyses."
